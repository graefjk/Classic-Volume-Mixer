# Classic Volume Mixer
In Windows 11 the old volume mixer was "removed" and instead a new mixer was added to the settings app.

I really don't like this due to it's HUGE size in comparison. Luckily the old exe is still available in system32, so we just need a convenient way to open it. 

Thats what this is, this repo contains a super simple application which only purpose is to add a new icon in the system tray that can be used to launch the old mixer.

I would recommend putting this in your startup folder so you don't have to start it every time you reboot your computer.
