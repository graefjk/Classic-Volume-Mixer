# Classic-Volume-Mixer
In Windows 11 the volume mixer was replaced by a UWP version, I preferred the old so I made this simple program to bring it back.
All this does is add a new icon to your system tray that when clicked launches the old mixer that can still be found at C:\windows\System32\sndvol.exe
